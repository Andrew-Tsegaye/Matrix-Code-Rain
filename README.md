# Matrix Code Rain with JavaScript

This is a simple Matrix Code Rain animation built with JavaScript. The code uses the HTML5 canvas to create the animation effect. The Matrix Code Rain effect was made famous by the movie "The Matrix" and has become a popular way to add a futuristic and cyberpunk style to websites and applications.

## Installation

To use this Matrix Code Rain animation on your website or application, you can simply copy the code from the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files into your own files. You will need to include the `script.js` file in your HTML file using a `<script>` tag.

Alternatively, you can also clone this repository using Git:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Andrew-Tsegaye/Matrix-Code-Rain.git
```

## Usage

To use the Matrix Code Rain animation, simply call the `startMatrix()` function in your JavaScript code. You can customize the animation by adjusting the parameters of this function. The available parameters are:

- `color`: The color of the code rain (default is green).
- `density`: The number of code rain characters (default is 50).
- `speed`: The speed of the code rain animation (default is 20).

Here is an example of how to use the `startMatrix()` function:

```bash
 startMatrix({
    color: "#00ff00",
    density: 100,
    speed: 10
 });
```
